          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
              <p>The charts, here scatter plots, display several positive correlation especially obesity, smoking and lack healthcare to the Poverty.
                In another world, the wealthier the state, the feweer health issue you have. Nevertheless, the visualizations indicate that the trends 
                are not absolute because we can identify some outliers. We can then identify North Dakota and Iowa who have a low poverty percentage by
                a high obesity rate.</p>
              <p>Some other element such as the Age are more difficult to explain. For all the three healthcare issue and lack of subscription, we can observe 
              that there is a cluster and most of the US states have their median ages between 36-40 years old. However, we can define some trends. the higher
               is the age median, the higher is the smoking percentage. This applies also to the obesity. At contrary, the higher is the age, lthe more subscriptions 
               you have to healthcare program.</p>
               <p> In the same direction, the higher the median income the more people subscribe to healthcare program and the less people are subject to obesity or smoking..
